Bug:
    When rotating objects rotate in the inverse direction in the x axis when bound to Camera (More testing needed)
    A lot on rotation
    Not sure why but Faces just absolutely break at certain angles

Impriovements:
    Add ranges of color, transparent PhysicalObjects can return a range from when to start to finish instead of a pair of HitMarks
    When in this range and a new HitMark is found the calculated opacity becomes (1-(opacity/unitVector)) ^ dist, added first.
    Add planes (Not the flying kind, the flat surface kind)
        Add polygon
            Add block...

    Remove Renderer (Me dum)

    Parallelize () using threading
    Use Bitmap to send information to label instead of canvas.

    Lighting

    Portals/ reflections (use a reflectCount to count down recurively)

    Load files (ex. stl, vrml)
